square_free_part(n): square_free_part(n) returns the largest square-free factor of n, where n is a positive integer.
0 -> None
-100 -> None
2.5 -> None
  getUniquePrimeFactorsWithCount(n): getUniquePrimeFactorsWithCount takes a positive integer n and returns a list of two lists, the first of which contains the unique prime factors of n in ascending order, and the second of which contains the number of times each prime factor appears in n.
    getAllPrimeFactors(n): getAllPrimeFactors(n) returns a list of all prime factors of n, where n is an integer greater than 1.
  get_factors(num): get_factors takes a positive integer and returns a list of all the positive integers that divide evenly into it.
