# Here is an example calculating the probability of landing on the same character in a random shift of an input string, based on the following problem:
# Vasya and Kolya play a game with a string, using the following rules. Initially, Kolya creates a string s, consisting of small English letters, and uniformly at random chooses an integer k from a segment [0, len(s) - 1]. He tells Vasya this string s, and then shifts it k letters to the left, i.Â e. creates a new string t = s_k + 1s_k + 2... s_ns_1s_2... s_k. Vasya does not know the integer k nor the string t, but he wants to guess the integer k. To do this, he asks Kolya to tell him the first letter of the new string, and then, after he sees it, open one more letter on some position, which Vasya can choose.
# Vasya understands, that he can't guarantee that he will win, but he wants to know the probability of winning, if he plays optimally. He wants you to compute this probability.
